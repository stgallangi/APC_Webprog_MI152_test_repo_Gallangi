 I enjoy my free time by sleeping because it makes me calm and </br>
 it feels good to sleep as well as eating. I also like to read </br>
 novel books and teen fiction books and I have already read a lot </br>
 of books, book series, and even non-mainstream books.</br>
 </br>
  I also enjoy watching anime because I learn a lot of new things </br>
  just like in reading. In anime, I also learn some Japanese words </br>
  which was nice and also in anime you can experience some things </br>
  you did not experienced yet. You can even learn some things in</br>
  here that you can actually use in the real life.</br>
  
  </br>

  </br>
  </br>
 
  I can say that listening to music is a part of my life. </br>
  Songs from my favorite artists like, The Vamps, Maroon 5, </br>
  All Time Low, P!ATD, and a lot more. I will share something </br>
  on you. I like All Time Low and Maroon 5 because they try </br>
  creating new songs in a genre they did not use before and it  </br>
  always comes out as good as if they were doing it a long time </br>
  ago. I was relieved when I heard and saw a new about the reunion</br>
  of the band My Chemical Romance and I am excited for their next</br>
  recordings this year.
  
  </br>
  </br>
 So these are some of the things I enjoy a lot and also I like playing </br>
 games. I am a big fan of pokemon, I have played almost all the version  </br>
 of it even if I don’t even have a Gameboy or a DS thanks to smartphones. I enjoy photography</br>
